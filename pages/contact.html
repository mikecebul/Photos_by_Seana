        <h1>Hi, my name is<br>Seana Hope</h1>

        <p>Yes, Seana Hope are both my first names so you can call me whatever is easiest for you.

          So why photography? I grew up spending my lunch breaks in the library, scanning books and learning about
          places by looking at the pictures in between the pages. As I got older, I have become so adventurous and with
          every journey I take, I enjoyed sharing them through my photos.

          I went to school and graduated with a bachelor's in Journalism, with Photojournalism as my saving grace. It
          had been such long years. While the spark for writing escaped me, I looked forward to the Film and
          Photojournalism. They were what I kept holding on to and got me through the years.

          Like everyone else, I want to capture every moment no matter how little. So if you see me without my camera,
          no worries because I still have my phone on me that does an awesome job too.

          I want the world to know that no matter where you're from, the world is at your fingertips. It doesn't matter
          whether you're actually on a plane going to your next destination, or scanning Instagram looking at the jaw
          dropping Auroras in Iceland. And through my camera and lenses, I too, will be there to share the world and
          make moments last for you and your loved ones.</p>
